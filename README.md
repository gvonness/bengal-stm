# Bengal STM
![Build Status](https://github.com/gvonness/bengal-stm/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)

Bengal STM is a library for writing composable concurrency operations based on in-memory transactions. The library itself handles all aspects of concurrency management including locking, retries, semantic blocking and optimised transaction scheduling. Generally, STM is a higher-level concurrency abstraction that provides a safe, efficient and composable alternate to locks, mutexes, etc. 

There are two aspects that differentiate Bengal from other STM implementations:
* ***Bengal runtime scheduler***: The Bengal runtime uses a custom scheduler that is not blindly optimistic. Transactions are scheduled based on a fast, static analysis of the transaction variable domain to lower the chances of transactions needing to be retried. This ensures _consistent_ performance, even for highly-contentious transactional variables/maps.
* ***Transactional Maps***: In addition to transactional variables, the implementation includes performant transactional maps as a core API data structure. This data structure provides performance benefits above wrapping an entire map in a transactional variable.

## Theory

As there are already many solid references on STM, I will not dive into STM theory here. However, I do highly recommend the writeup in [Beautiful Concurrency](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/beautiful.pdf) for those interested in learning about this concurrency pattern.

### Example
Note in the below that the [better-monadic-for](https://github.com/oleg-py/better-monadic-for) compiler plugin is used to expose the STM runtime as an implicit in the monadic computation. This is avoids the use of `unsafeRunSync` to expose the runtime instance, while not requiring the runtime to be explicitly passed to the sub-programs.

## PR FAQ
### What is a PR FAQ?
Take a look at [the Medium article on PR FAQs](https://medium.com/agileinsider/press-releases-for-product-managers-everything-you-need-to-know-942485961e31) for a good overview of the concept. I have taken some liberties with the formatting, but I generally like the concept of a living FAQ to help introduce products.

### Why another STM implementation?
I found that blindly optimistic execution strategies led to very poor performance of STM in a number of production scenarios. The situation could only be remedied by sequentially executing queued transactions within a given runtime. I.e. the transactional nature of STM became moot, as I was essentially reducing concurrent execution back down to sequential execution. Thus, I decided to build an STM backed by a scheduler that was more conducive to handling high-contention scenarios, while still being genuinely concurrent. 

Beyond the scheduler, I also wanted to explore adding `Map` as a fundamental transactional data structure to analogise the concept of an index in a DB. This presents some interesting challenges with scheduling around structural (i.e. the 'CRD' in 'CRUD') updates to the map itself, but it's a data structure I just found to be very useful in transactional contexts.

### Why not just contribute to another project?
Indeed, [cats-stm](https://timwspence.github.io/cats-stm/) already exists and provides a nice STM implementation for Cats Effect (Try it!).

Given the requirements I had for the transaction scheduler, I decided that the underpinning implementation would be quite different than cats-stm. In particular, this implementation is based on [Free Monads](https://typelevel.org/cats/datatypes/freemonad.html) that use different interpreters for static analysis and building the transactional log. 

Also, while APIs are quite similar, there are some differences between Bengal and cats-stm. For example, cats-stm has a way to bypass retries with `orElse`, which is not something present in Bengal (this is an intentional design decision). Also, initialisation of `TxnVar` and `TxnVarMap` happen outside the context of the `Txn[_]` monad.

### Why isn't there a way to bypass `waitFor`?
I wanted `waitFor` to have a clear semantic delineation from an `if` statement in the monadic construction. While there is arguably a missed opportunity to define a canonical Semigroup via such a bypass, I have opted for a simpler API (for the time being).

In addition to this, Bengal short-circuits the rest of the monadic evaluation when encountering a failed `waitFor` predicate. This performance optimisation is not possible if we need to search the computation spec for a `waitFor` bypass.

### Why 'Bengal'?
Bengals are a very playful and active cat breed. I figured the name worked for something built on Cats ;).
